using helm instead of fzf.

You can browse the fonts installed on your system and show a preview, copy the font name or path and set the frame font.

* Installation

Fontpreview-mode depends on [[https://www.imagemagick.org][imagemagick]], which is probably already installed on you system. 
It also depends on [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/wiki][helm]].

Clone the repository or just download fontpreview-mode.el and put it in the load-path.

Put the following somewhere in your .emacs file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'fontpreview-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Just run M-x fontpreview to run fontpreview.
